# UDemyTestNinja
The work I did when going through Mosh Hamedani's Unit Testing C# courses.

Before this course my only unit testing experience was a class in college. My previous company did not unit test at all! Crazy right? Instead of unit testing they employeed a full team of QA testers that manually tested every application.

So now I have an in depth understanding of unit tests in general, unit test conventions, and experience with NUnit.
